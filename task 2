Transport infra-structure is the backbone to development of a country. Some believe in constructing new railway lines between cities and other have a view that improving existing public transport is the right direction to go. Both views have their our merits and demerits which are discussed in this article.

To begin with, the construction of new railway lines with very fast trains can reduce the travel time. For instance, the introduction of new fast railway track between Tokyo and Kyoto in Japan in 2019 reduced the travel time from 1 hour to 20 mins. In addition to that this can also be used to introduce new technology which are more energy efficient like Maglev trains and more cost effective in the long run. Improving existing public transport can hinder the flow of traffic during the construction period which can have the negative effect.

However improving the exisiting public transport has it's own positives. Constructing new railway lines can be really expensive and take a long period of time. Whereas improving the exisiting public transport requires less money and takes less time. For instance, in a survey conducted by London Public Works Department found that the slow moving traffic decreased by thirty percent after the reconstruction of roads and highways which took less that 6 months. The travel fee on high speed trains can be really expensive because of which it can be hard for common people to afford it.


In conclusion, the construction of new railway lines can take a very long period of time so existing public transport can be improved in this time so that it can improve the transportion temporarly before switching to faster trains. Hence, constructing new railway lines between cities and improving existing public transport can be done together and is a step to the right direction.
